# Week 3: Reading Assignment - Geoff Boeing

## Reaction to Readings
Reading through the "Off the Grid" article, one theme kept popping up and that is the balancing the relationship between environment and the build environment
(i.e. roads). I liked the quote that Boeing included in the article: "Street network design cannot merely reflect short-sighted transportation paradigms: 
due to its near-permance, planners must carefully plan for decades or centuries of travel behavior, flexibly and sustainably." Planners need to carefully consider
not only today's needs, but future needs because constructing roadways and buildings is a near-permanance act. Roads were used to "impose urbane order over the landscape,
to streamline transportation systems, ... to organize the city democratically...." We can see that grids were used from the 18th century until about the 1930s, until
the influence of the automobiles came about. The Institute of Transportation Engineers recommended loops and culs-de-sacs and less 4-way intersections. Really fascinating
to see how innovations and inventions can have a real, near-permanent effect on the landscape.

## Comments/Questions to Ask Author
1. It sounds like grid design was efficient. Then cars came into the picture, and there was pressure to embrace the automobile experience, resulting in a direction
away from grid design. Now the trend is back to grid design, since this promotes active transportation and helps with public transit. Do you see grid design going
back into the shadows anytime soon?
1. Why is griddedness an urban phenomenon? Do you see this changing in the future?
1. I found it really interesting that the automobiles had such a big impact on the way streets were designed. I wonder if another factor could illicit a similar response
in these times?
