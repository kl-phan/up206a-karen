<h1> Profile </h1>
<h2> Karen Phan</h2>

First-year MURP Student

Born and raised in Southern California, I am currently pursuing a Master of Urban and Regional Planning (MURP) with a focus on Transportation Policy & Planning at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs.

A proud alumna of UC Berkeley, I have interests in transportation/travel demand management, using data analytics to optimize transit service, and learning how to make our roads safer and more efficient with technology.

<h1>Course Description</h1>

Welcome to the world of planning and spatial thinking. In recent years, our relationship with maps and map-making has changed dramatically. No longer are we limited to a mode of map-making that is dominated by industry giants like Google and ESRI. Instead, a suite of data-science tools have matured to a point where they can produce similar, if not, more powerful and creative ways that advance spatial exploration.

Our understanding of social phenomena through spatial constructs in urban data allows us to address questions on social justice, the environment, transportation, community development and design, amongst many other themes, and how these factors may affect different population groups in different ways. This course prepares you for challenges in urban data beyond off-the-shelf cartographic approaches. It looks at the various components of data’s journey—acquisition, exploration, modeling, and communication through visualization—and how it enables and advances your research from a data science perspective.

The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of spatial data science. Where once there was a dearth of available digital information, we now live in a world of too much data. How can these data be transformed to human expressions and narratives that are utilized in planning? We begin with an introduction to various data science tools, and review the basics of programming with Python. Once a foundation of Python programming and data wrangling is achieved, spatial analysis through Python Libraries, and subsequently, through advanced geoprocessing will be introduced. All lessons will be based on “real” data with analytical methods addressing relevant and contemporary urban problems. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research.

While there are no prerequisites for taking this course, people who are approaching programming for the first time will admittedly find the course to be intense and challenging.

<h1> Project Ideas</h1>

   1. Researching how traffic accidents have been affected during the COVID-19 period <br>
   2. Researching where and/when there is an increase in traffic accidents <br>
   3. Researching what cars/demographic/etc has the most traffic accidents 

<h1> Objectives for Course </h1>

As someone who is completely new to programming and very minimal experience with data analysis in this context, I'd like to be able to get more familiar and comfortable with these topics. Particularly, I'm interested in learning some introductionary Python and learn where to find good data-sets and how to analyze/use them for my purposes.
