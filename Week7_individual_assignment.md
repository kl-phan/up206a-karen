## Week 7 Individual Assignment 

Research Paper: "Parking search caused congestion: Where's all the fuss?"

I enjoyed reading this paper because I found it fascinating that looking for parking ("cruising") was so researchable! Whenever I need to go run my errands, I expect to spend some time looking for parking. For some reason, it never occurred to me that this frequent, little thing was something that could be so researchable! Which seems to be in line with how "fewer emerging technologies have been been devoted to understanding the cruising process itself." 

I also agreed with the statement that the "decision-making process involved in each element of the search is highly dependent on a complex interaction" between many different factors, such as drivers' parking preferences, trip characteristics, etc. If I'm pressed for time, for example, I  might park farther and just walk instead of spending time in the hopes of finding closer parking. If I am not pressed for time, I will prefer to park in a shaded area. 

I found amusing that driver's often exaggerate their search time in surveys. Often times, when we want to do something else, any second we spend not doing that activity feels much longer. Something I can definitely relate to! 

Questions:
* I'm not that familiar with what a data broker is. The random, anonymized trips in San Francisco that were analyzed... I'm guessing it must be from some sort of taxi/Uber/Lyft service? 
* Weather might play a case in parking situations. If it's raining, I'd want to park close as possible and would likely do multiple rounds around the block. How might weather as a factor change the study?
