### Individual Assignment

I digitized over 100 buildings ([my OSM profile link](https://www.missingmaps.org/users/#/KarenPhan_)), and attended a portion of the "GIS with R" workshop. Digitizing the buildings is a task I found fulfilling and easy to do. For this assignment, I focused on Indonesia and West Africa. In my downtime or while I watch a show, I can see myself continuing to digitize buildings! I also attended a small portion of the "GIS with R" workshop and found it insightful. I had no knowledge of R Studio or R, so found the introductory session helpful.
